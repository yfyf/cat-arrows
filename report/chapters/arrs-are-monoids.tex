\section{Arrows are monoids}

%% Disclaimer: I allowed myself to freestyle here, so please read with
%% suspicion.

We now explore a rather simplified interpretation of arrows, mostly following
the one initially described by Heunen \& Jacobs~\cite{arr-like-mon}. Our spirit
here is to just assume that the naive categorical interpretations of arrow
definitions are correct and then see what structure this gives us.
Using this approach we end up with the fact that arrows can be seen as monoids
on the category of bifunctors $\opcat{\catC} \times \catC \to \catC$.
Moreover, we also obtain a (sloppy) bijection between Freyd categories and
the aforementioned monoidal structure induced by arrows.

Since arrows are first of all a computational notion in functional programming,
to begin, we can, as usual, assume our working domain is some cartesian closed
category $\catC$. In particular, we can consider $\catC$ to be the category
$\Hask$ of Haskell types and functions.

Having this domain in mind, we can try to provide a categorical interpretation
of a Haskell \verb|(Arrow a)| instance. First, observe that every type
constructor \verb|f :: * -> *| in Haskell induces a subcategory of $\Hask$
where all types (i.e.~objects) are of the form \verb|f a|.  Similarly,
the \verb|(Arrow a)| type constructor \verb|a| of kind \verb|* -> (* -> *)|
also induces a subcategory of function types.\footnote{%
For intuition, observe that e.g. the function type constructor
\texttt{(->)} is of kind \texttt{* -> (* -> *)}}
%% can't use \verb in footnote for mysterious reasons

With these observations, we can deduce that it is reasonable to consider
\verb|(Arrow a)| categorically as, firstly, a map $A$, whose object part is
of the form $|\catC| \to |\catC \Rightarrow \catC|$, which after uncurrying
becomes $|A|: |\catC| \times |\catC| \to |\catC|$. Moreover, since we want $A$
to play nice with Haskell functions, we assume it is well-behaved with respect
to morphisms in $\Hask$, which boils down to $A$ being bifunctorial.

Moreover, we see $A$ is contravariant in the first variable and covariant in
the second. Thus we can conclude that $A$ is in fact an endo-profunctor on
$\catC$, i.e.~$A: \opcat{\catC} \times \catC \to \catC$. We later prove our
assumptions are correct\footnote{It should be added: ``correct for the naive
interpretation''} and now consider the additional structure induced by
the arrow operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|arr| is a function of type \verb|(b -> c) -> a b c|.
        The categorical interpretation of a function type is simply an internal
        hom in $\catC$, hence we get that categorically \verb|arr| corresponds
        to a functor sending homs in $\catC$ to homs in the subcategory induced
        by $A$, i.e.: $arr: [B \Rightarrow C] \mapsto A(B, C)$. Alternatively, one
        can say that $arr$ is a collection of natural transformations
        $arr_{BC}$, sending morphisms $B \to C$ in $\catC$ to morphisms in $A$;
    \item similarly, \verb|first| is function of type
        \verb|a b c -> a (b, d) (c, d)|
        corresponding to a family of morphisms\\
        $first_{BCD}: A(B, C) \to A(B \times D,C \times D)$\\
        or as a functor $first$ sending homs $A(-, +)$ to homs $A(- \times D, +
        \times D)$;
    \item finally, \verb|(>>>)| is function of type \verb|a b c -> a c d -> a b d|.
        If $A$ were closed then, we could interpret \verb|(>>>)| as a
        map\\
        $\ggg_{BCD}: A(B, C) \to (A(C, D) \Rightarrow A(B, D))$.\\
        However, this is not the case in general, so instead we can view
        \verb|(>>>)| as a family of morphisms\\
        $\ggg_{BCD}: A(B, C) \times A(C, D) \to A(B, D)$\\
\end{itemize}

We assume for now that our interpretations are correct (in particular, that the
claimed natural transformations are actually natural) and move on to take a
closer look at $\ggg$.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Lemma~3.3]{arr-like-mon}}]
    The maps $\ggg: A(X, P) \times (P, Y) \to A(X, Y)$ are natural in $X$,
    $Y$ and dinatural in $P$.
\end{lemma}

Advanced category theory wizards upon spotting dinaturality take to looking
for a tensor structure~\cite[p.~8]{arr-like-mon}. Hence we shall try to follow
their path.
