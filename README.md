Arrows in category theory and computation
=========================================

This is a scholarly collaboration with [@knuton](https://github.com/knuton).

This repository will hold our explorations of Arrows both as category theoretic
objects and as notions in computation (in particular, in Haskell).

Here is a tentative table of contents:

    1. Introduction
       .... What is the problem of treating general forms of computation
            in pure languages? How does Haskell approach it? Announce
            problem with monadic approach, arrow solution and interest
            for category theoretical interpretation.
    2. Modelling Computation in Theory and Practice
       2.1 Arrows in Haskell
           .... Introduce arrows as they appear in Haskell
       2.2 Freyd categories
           .... Introduce Freyd categories as described in denotational
                semantics
       2.3 Arrows are Freyd categories!
           .... Jump to conclusion on observing obvious parallels, but
                backtrack and demand more rigorous analysis.
    3. Aligning Theory and Practice
       .... Preliminaries & redrawing Jabob &al's construction
       3.1 Category Theoretical Preliminaries
       3.2 Construction
    5. Discussion
       .... Success and benefits of theoretical insights; The
            Awkwardness of modelling Hask

If time permits:

  * A Categorial Model of Hask
    .... How can we think of Haskell categorically, or more
         generally, how can we think of pure computation
         categorically?
  * Redraw Atkey's improved version
    

Hang tight!
